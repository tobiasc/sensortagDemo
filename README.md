# sensortagDemo

It'll run every 200ms and collect temperature, humidity, accelerometer, & gyroscope data. 
First is discovers the device, then connects to it, and eventually it'll start collecting data from it (usually takes 5-15 seconds).

Initially the printing is turned off, you can toggle it on/off by cliking the left button. The initial printing lower threshold for humidity and temperature is 30% & 25C. You can change these values by clicking the right button, click a single time to increase the lower threshold by 1. Initially it's set to change temperature, but if you click twice within 250 milliseconds it'll switch mode to humidity.

### How to get started
1. Install NodeJS (http://nodejs.org/)
2. Install dependencies `> npm install` 
3. Run code `> npm start`
4. Press the "connect button" on the SensorTag

Sample Output:
```
> npm start
